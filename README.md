CodSoft Team,

I wanted to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude for the remote internship experience in machine learning. Working independently on each project provided a unique opportunity to develop my technical skills and gain hands-on exposure to real-world applications. The guidance and support I received were invaluable in helping me navigate challenges and deepen my understanding.

Thank you for this opportunity, which has greatly contributed to my growth. I look forward to applying what I've learned in future projects.

Customer Churn Prediction

This project focuses on building a predictive model to identify customers likely to churn from a subscription-based service or business. Using historical customer data, including demographics and behavioral patterns, the model aims to classify customers as likely to churn or retain.

Introduction
Predicting customer churn is critical for subscription-based businesses to retain valuable customers and improve customer satisfaction. This project uses machine learning models to predict churn based on customer data, employing algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.

Dataset
The dataset (churn_data.csv) includes demographic and usage information about customers, with features like age, subscription length, usage frequency, and customer type. The target variable is churn, where 1 indicates a churned customer, and 0 indicates a retained customer.

Features
Typical features in this project may include:

Customer Demographics: Age, location, gender, etc.
Usage Behavior: Frequency of usage, average time spent, number of interactions, etc.
Subscription Information: Length of subscription, renewal status, subscription type.
Feature Engineering: New features are created from existing columns to better capture patterns related to churn.

Modeling
The project uses three main machine learning algorithms to predict churn:

Logistic Regression: A simple linear model, often a good baseline for classification tasks.
Random Forest: An ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and averages their predictions for improved accuracy.
Gradient Boosting: An ensemble model that sequentially improves by learning from previous errors, offering high predictive performance.
Model Evaluation
The models are evaluated using:

Accuracy: The percentage of correct predictions.
Precision, Recall, and F1-score: For evaluating the balance between false positives and false negatives.
ROC-AUC: To measure the modelâ€™s ability to distinguish between churned and retained customers.

Results
The model results include metrics and confusion matrices for each algorithm, helping determine the most effective model for predicting customer churn.
